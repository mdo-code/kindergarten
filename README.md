Webpage for a kindergarden

It's not ready yet!
I bring the old page from my sons kindergarden from 2000 to the year 2016.
Getting rid of the frames and make it usable on mobile phones and tablets.

It is hosted with absolut minimum serverstuff. So i programm it with angularJS, because with that there will be only small 
templates for the Kindergarden staff to fill in news and occasional text changes.
